# Introduction to Python Programming 🐍

Hey there! 👋

Welcome to the **Introduction to Python Programming** course! These are the 5 Python lessons I created at the end of 2020 for three groups of audacious friends.

If you'd like to start programming, this is the right place. You don't need to install anything—the code runs on **Google Colab**, which is a cloud platform provided by Google. The files you see here are **IPython Notebooks** (`.ipynb` files), which are a mix of text notes and code, making it easy to follow along and interact with the code.

Use the lesson links below to open each notebook in Colab.

## Files Explained 📄

For each lesson, the main file is:

- **`.ipynb` files**: These are interactive notebooks that you can open in Google Colab. They contain both explanations and executable code cells, allowing you to read the notes and run the code directly in your browser.

## Course Outline 📚

Here's a brief overview of what each lesson covers:

### **[Lesson 1: Introduction](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bzznrc/bazza-camp/blob/main/python/1_Intro.ipynb)**

- **Files**: `1_Intro.ipynb`
- **Description**:
  - Learn about variables, data types, and basic operations.
  - Understand how to perform input and output in Python.
  - Get familiar with writing and running Python scripts.

### **[Lesson 2: Conditions](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bzznrc/bazza-camp/blob/main/python/2_Conditions.ipynb)**

- **Files**: `2_Conditions.ipynb`
- **Description**:
  - Explore conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
  - Learn about comparison and logical operators.
  - Practice making decisions in your code based on conditions.

### **[Lesson 3: Loops](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bzznrc/bazza-camp/blob/main/python/3_Loops.ipynb)**

- **Files**: `3_Loops.ipynb`
- **Description**:
  - Dive into loops (`for` and `while`) and iteration.
  - Understand how to repeat actions efficiently.
  - Learn about loop control statements like `break` and `continue`.

### **[Lesson 4: Lists](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bzznrc/bazza-camp/blob/main/python/4_Lists.ipynb)**

- **Files**: `4_Lists.ipynb`
- **Description**:
  - Get to know lists and how to manipulate them.
  - Learn about list operations, slicing, and methods.
  - Understand how to work with collections of data.

### **[Lesson 5: Extra](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bzznrc/bazza-camp/blob/main/python/5_Extra.ipynb)**

- **Files**: `5_Extra.ipynb`
- **Description**:
  - Apply what you've learned in practical exercises.
  - Explore additional topics like functions and basic object-oriented programming.
  - See how the concepts come together in real-world scenarios.

Happy coding! 🙂

# Introduction to SQL 🗄️

Hey there! 👋

Welcome to the **Introduction to SQL** course! This course is designed to help you get started with SQL, the language used to interact with relational databases.

Just like the Python course, you don't need to install anything. The code runs on **Google Colab**, which provides a cloud-based environment for running SQL queries and managing data.

## Files Explained 📄

For each lesson, the main file is the notebook (`.ipynb`). The course also includes one shared database file:

- **`.ipynb` files**: These are interactive notebooks that can be opened in Google Colab or compatible environments. They contain both explanations and SQL code cells, allowing you to read the notes and run the queries directly.

- **`my_database.db`**: This is the sample SQLite database used throughout the lessons.

## Course Outline 📚

Here's a brief overview of what each lesson covers:

### **[Lesson 0: Tables](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bzznrc/bazza-camp/blob/main/sql/0_Tables.ipynb)**

- **Files**: `0_Tables.ipynb`
- **Description**:
  - Learn how to create and populate tables.
  - Understand data types and table schemas.
  - Set up the initial data we'll use throughout the course.

### **[Lesson 1: Select](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bzznrc/bazza-camp/blob/main/sql/1_Select.ipynb)**

- **Files**: `1_Select.ipynb`
- **Description**:
  - Master the basic `SELECT` statement to retrieve data.
  - Learn how to filter data using `WHERE`.
  - Explore sorting results with `ORDER BY` and limiting output with `LIMIT`.
  - Use `DISTINCT` to find unique values.

### **[Lesson 2: Join](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bzznrc/bazza-camp/blob/main/sql/2_Join.ipynb)**

- **Files**: `2_Join.ipynb`
- **Description**:
  - Understand how to combine data from multiple tables using `JOIN`s.
  - Learn about different types of joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, etc.
  - Practice writing queries that involve complex table relationships.

### **[Lesson 3: Group](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bzznrc/bazza-camp/blob/main/sql/3_Group.ipynb)**

- **Files**: `3_Group.ipynb`
- **Description**:
  - Dive into aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `COUNT`.
  - Learn how to group data using `GROUP BY`.
  - Understand how to filter grouped data with `HAVING`.
  - Apply aggregate functions to gain insights from data.
